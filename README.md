# Kikimasu

## About

I wanted to be able to listen to Pandora around the house without having to keep clicking a link every hour, so I wrote this extension for Chrome that "props" open Pandora by clicking the "I'm still here" link automatically. It also ensures that the music stream is not paused at any point. 

## Usage

Clicking the icon in the URL bar allows you to pause Kikimasu.
