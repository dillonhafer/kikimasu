== Kikimasu - A small extension allowing continuous playback of Pandora.

I wanted to be able to listen to Pandora around the house without having to keep clicking a link every hour, so I wrote this extension for Chrome that "props" open Pandora by clicking the "I'm still here" link automatically. It also ensures that the music stream is not paused at any point. 

[Latest Version 1.0]
* Clicking the page icon allows you to manually pause pandora.
